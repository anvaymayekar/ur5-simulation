# ü§ñ UR5 Robotic Arm Pick-and-Place Simulation

<br>

A comprehensive **UR5 robotic arm simulation** implementing multi-object **pick-and-place tasks** with real-time control capabilities. The project leverages MATLAB's **Robotics System Toolbox** to simulate the robot, its kinematics, and object manipulation. Users can interactively configure objects, dynamically adjust animation speed during execution, and run the simulation with a user-friendly GUI.

> üí° Developed as part of a **robotics simulation micro-project** for the course **Fundamentals of Robotics** under **Prof. Salaba Jacob**, this demonstrates the principles of **inverse kinematics, trajectory planning, smooth path transitions, and GUI-based control** for industrial robot tasks.

## üß† Code Architecture & Concepts

The simulation is implemented in a **modular and object-oriented style** with clear separation of concerns:

### 1. **Robot Initialization**
- Loads the **UR5 rigid body tree** model with gravity and row-based configuration.
- Home position is defined, and workspace boundaries are set for proper visualization with cubic aspect ratio.
- End-effector tracking allows real-time visualization of positions during the simulation.
- Enables full 3D interaction (rotate, zoom, pan) with preserved aspect ratios.

### 2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
- Built using MATLAB **uicontrols** and **uipanels** with a modern dark theme.
- Interactive controls include:
  - **Number of objects** to manipulate (dynamically adjustable).
  - **Real-time animation speed slider** with live update during simulation.
  - **Object configuration table**: Editable pick and place coordinates (X, Y, Z).
  - **Quick presets**: Line, Circle, Grid, Random arrangements.
  - **Add/Remove object buttons**: Dynamically modify object count during configuration.
  - **Start/Reset buttons**: Run and stop simulation with state management.
- Status messages provide real-time feedback on current operation.
- Live end-effector position display updated every few frames.

### 3. **Pick-and-Place Logic**
- The robot moves sequentially to **pick each object** and place it at the target location.
- Smooth motion is generated using **inverse kinematics** and **trap velocity trajectory (`trapveltraj`)** for natural movement.
- **Intelligent path planning**: After placing an object, the robot automatically follows a smooth path to the next object's pick position.
- Hover heights are used to avoid collisions when moving between positions.
- Objects are represented as **colored cubes**, with their movement visually attached to the end-effector during transport.
- **Attach/detach logic**: Objects are picked up at the pick position and released at the place position with precise timing.

### 4. **Trajectory & Inverse Kinematics**
- Uses MATLAB's `inverseKinematics` object to calculate joint configurations for desired end-effector poses.
- Trajectories are **generated segment-wise**, connecting waypoints for pick and place with smooth interpolation.
- **Waypoint system**:
  - First object: Home ‚Üí Above Pick ‚Üí Pick ‚Üí Above Pick ‚Üí Above Place ‚Üí Place ‚Üí Above Place
  - Subsequent objects: Previous Place ‚Üí Above Pick ‚Üí Pick ‚Üí Above Pick ‚Üí Above Place ‚Üí Place ‚Üí Above Place
- Real-time **speed adjustment** allows dynamic control of animation velocity during execution without restarting.
- Smooth transitions between all waypoints using trapezoidal velocity profiles.

### 5. **Visualization**
- Simulation window shows:
  - 3D robot model with accurate UR5 kinematics.
  - Pick-and-place object positions (red/green markers).
  - Moving objects (colored cubes) with dynamic trails showing path history.
  - Real-time end-effector position display (X, Y, Z coordinates).
- Full **3D interaction** is enabled: rotate, zoom, and pan with preserved aspect ratio.
- Path trails visualized with unique colors for each object.
- Cubic workspace with equal aspect ratios prevents distortion during interaction.

### 6. **Dynamic Control Features**
- **Real-time speed control**: Adjust animation speed using the slider during simulation execution.
- **Multi-object support**: Add or remove objects before starting simulation.
- **Pause and reset**: Stop simulation at any time and reset to initial state.
- **Preset patterns**: Quickly load predefined object arrangements (line, circle, grid, random).
- **Editable coordinates**: Manually adjust pick and place positions in the table.

### 7. **Utilities**
- Functions for:
  - **Cube creation** (`createCube`) with vertices and faces for 3D object representation.
  - **Preset loading** (line, circle, grid, random) for easy object configuration.
  - **Dynamic add/remove object functionality** with automatic table updates.
  - **Trajectory segment calculation** for precise attach/detach timing.
  - **Real-time position updates** with frame-based throttling for performance.
